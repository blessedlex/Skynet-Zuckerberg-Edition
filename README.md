## Executive Project Summary
Training an artificial intelligence to better understand the world through the images that it sees is clearly of interest to Facebookâ€™s overall business model. "Yann LeCun (director of FAIR "Facebook AI Research") says that he's confident Facebook's facial recognition is the best in the world, and that it's a key difference between Facebook and academic research institutions. Now, DeepFace is driving force behind Facebook's automatic photo tagging" (Gershgorn). Artificial intelligence-based or AI-based systems like robots and assistants are becoming more and more prominent as the digital landscape continues to expand. As artificial intelligence frameworks are additionally incorporated into crucial parts of society such as mainstream social media applications, any and/or all software applications utilizing an AI-based system such a facial recognition, speaks to the rising curiousity of data privacy with the possibility of affecting the personal security of end users. Facebook specifically has been increasing their footprint in this area. From complex AI algorithm's to extracting data from our images to utilizing artificial neural networks to auto-tag people in photos, Facebook's dedicated engineers intend to create the artificial intelligence of the future. Our goal is to test and analyze Facebook's open source facial recognition libraries to determine if user information is being mishandled based on how it is being collected. Distinctively, calling attention to the particular use of their facial recognition systems and the data collected from it. 

The main objectives that we've outlined include:
- Analyzing Facebook's open source facial recognition and AI libraries 
- Documenting what information or data is extracted from user videos and images
- Determining if the collection of this data is improper

The merit of accomplishing our project goal and objectives is to go beyond spreading awareness about Facebook's AI research and user policy agreements. We expect to further expose and advance the conversation about what exactly Facebook may be designing in their AI research labs. The end goal may be beneficial to soceity but as we've seen from Facebook's previous history with Cambridge Analytica, is our data truly in the best hands? Furthermore, how is their facial recognition systems utilizing user data behind the scenes?

## Proposed Project Timeline
Below is our proposed project timeline. Our Kanban board can be found here: [Project Sprint Plan](https://github.com/blessedlex/Skynet-Zuckerberg-Edition/projects/1)

## Project-Oriented Risk List
In our risk list, we have identified the major sources of risk and what we plan to do about them in case they arise.

|Risk Name  | Impact     | Likelihood | Description | Mitigation |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
|Team Member Availability (28) | 7 | 4 | Aligning meeting times around academic and work schedules may deem difficult | Plan is to meet each week after weekly check-ins with Dr. Hale until an issue may arise |
|Communication/Under communication (24) | 8 | 3 | If any requirements are misinterpreted by the project team a gap develops between expectations, requirements and milestones | May need to communicate the same idea many times in different ways before people remember it |
|Software Availability (27) | 9 | 3 | Not all of the necessary software for analysis may be open source | Work around would be to check UNO's available software for students or low cost subscription options|
|Analysis Complexity (28) | 7 | 4 | The scope of the analysis may be very large for our time frame | Focus on AI and facial recognition and its handling specifically instead of all the research of Facebook's AI and data usage|
| Learning Curves (35) | 7 | 5 | Project team may need to acquire new skills for the project so there's a risk that productivity will be low | Try to keep the best member for a certain task doing what they understand best |

## Literature Review
[LitReview](https://github.com/blessedlex/Skynet-Zuckerberg-Edition/blob/master/litreview.md) <br>
[Appendix](https://github.com/blessedlex/Skynet-Zuckerberg-Edition/blob/master/appendixes.md)

## Project Methodology
Based on the articles, we plan on examing and testing the code libraries for data vulnerablities. 

Discovery Stage
- Data analysis of their code libraries<br> 
We plan to comb through the deepmask and multipath repositositories. While looking through these repositories, we will be taking short notes over what each file does. This allows us to be more focused on the process and less on the code. Most efforts of documentation will be for the data that is obtained and how it will be obtained. We plan to take notes on the data structure to see how the data is represented. Through this we can analyze the empty shell and see the type of data that is being stored. Also, we are taking notes on the behavior of the AI. By understanding the behavior of the AI, we can see what information is needed to complete its job. This will be done by seeing what functions are used and training that is involved.
- Data collection of Facebook's Policy on Privacy, Data, and Terms 
- We will observe and document how the code work and policy used by Facebook 
- Research Convolutional Nerual Networks (CNN) 
- We will research and document how CNNs work and are used by Facebook 

Implementation Stage
- Review and test opt-out options for Facebook's facial recognition 
- Test the auto-tagging freature on Facebook 
- Continue to document findings in published article on Facebook Facial AI 
  - Repeat published test on Facebook's AI

Delivery Stage
- Compile all findings into GitHub repository and files
- Create a Report and Presentation on our results from test

## Resources Needed
|Resource  | Dr. Hale needed? | Investigating Team member | Description |
|-------------------|---------|---------------------------|-------------|
|Facebook policies | No | Caroline | Digging in to the policies to see how the data is used within Facebook  |
|Facebook Open Source Library | No | Entire Team | Digging into the library to exam how the data is used and transferred in to Facebook storage. Examples: DeepFace|
|Library Database | No | Entire Team| Using Library Database to gather backgrpund information on facial recognitions |
|Lua | No | Entire Team | Programming Language of DeepFace and MultiPathNet |
