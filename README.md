## Executive Project Summary
Training an artificial intelligence to better understand the world through the images that it sees is clearly of interest to Facebookâ€™s overall business model. "Yann LeCun (director of FAIR "Facebook AI Research") says that he's confident Facebook's facial recognition is the best in the world, and that it's a key difference between Facebook and academic research institutions. Now, DeepFace is driving force behind Facebook's automatic photo tagging" (Watson et al.). Artificial intelligence-based or AI-based systems like robots and assistants are becoming more and more prominent as the digital landscape continues to expand. As artificial intelligence frameworks are additionally incorporated into crucial parts of society such as mainstream social media applications, any and/or all software applications utilizing an AI-based system such a facial recognition, speaks to the rising curiousity of data privacy with the possibility of affecting the personal security of end users. Facebook specifically has been increasing their footprint in this area. From complex AI algorithm's to extracting data from our images to utilizing artificial neural networks to auto-tag people in photos, Facebook's dedicated engineers intend to create the artificial intelligence of the future. Our goal is to test and analyze Facebook's open source facial recognition libraries to determine if user information is being mishandled based on how it is being collected. Distinctively, calling attention to the particular use of their facial recognition systems and the data collected from it. 

The main objectives that we've outlined include:
- Analyzing Facebook's open source facial recognition and AI libraries 
- Documenting what information or data is extracted from user videos and images
- Determining if the collection of this data is improper

The merit of accomplishing our project goal and objectives is to go beyond spreading awareness about Facebook's AI research and user policy agreements. We expect to further expose and advance the conversation about what exactly Facebook may be designing in their AI research labs. The end goal may be beneficial to soceity but as we've seen from Facebook's previous history with Cambridge Analytica, is our data truly in the best hands? Furthermore, how is their facial recognition systems utilizing user data behind the scenes?
