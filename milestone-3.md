# Progress Report (12.16.2020)
## Overview
We have shifted our focus as mentioned previously in the milestone 2 progress report. After adjusting our efforts to be focused on the analyzing of Facebook's open source coding libraries, utilizing the Postman API for HTTP method captures, and training the coding algorithms with different test model loads to draw conclusions about potential privacy implications; we have progressed through our milestone 3 objectives, achieving new information and results that align with our project's new and adjusted scope.

Splitting up the work load for this milestone looked differently than earlier on in the semester. Individually, we either researched, tested, documented, and/or produced our findings to compile in this final deliverable. Most efforts were directed towards our environment setup and training the coding algorithms and testing the models. Next, we also conducted more research into terminology, DeepMask and MultiPathNet neural network diagrams, documentation, and a more in-depth search for supplemental literature reviews on the coding algorithms we choose.

Ultimately, from analyzing and training the code algorithms from Facebook's open source libraries, we are able to pull some implications from our findings. Listed below are our outcomes.

## Outcomes
* Outcome 1: After fully integrating our setup enivornment in Milestone 2, we achieved the training of our coding algorithm, DeepMask, so that we could begin testing the model. We achieved the testing results after 5 days of training took place. The results are linked here: [DeepMask Results](https://github.com/blessedlex/Skynet-Zuckerberg-Edition/blob/master/deepmask_results.md)

* Outcome 2: Diagram of what the neural network looks like for DeepMask and MultiPathNet -- [Neural Network Diagrams](https://github.com/blessedlex/Skynet-Zuckerberg-Edition/blob/master/neural_network_diagrams.md)

* Outcome 3: We were able to determine what the facial recognition libraries use and the potential privacy implications for that use and summarize and conclude the results we observed from the algorithms. 


## Hinderances
We were not able to complete training and testing of the MultiPathNet algorithm due to time constraints and our hardware capabilities. Our hardware was not able to reduce the length of time it takes for the algorithm to be completely trained. Before changing direction in our scope, we may have been about to mitigate this challenge by utilizing the Holland Computing Center on-campus at the Peter Kiewit Institute. 

Making sense of the terminology from our training and testing hindered our overall comprehension of what the training results revealed. More research into this was necessary to get a better understanding due to an ultimate learning curve for our team. From our initial goals and objectives, we did not account a change in scope mid-way through Milestone 2. This completely changed our expected outcomes leading our team to compensate for the change in direction and hustle to compile non-trivial findings and outcomes in a short time window.
