# Progress Report (12.16.2020)
## Overview
We had shifted our focus as mentioned previously in the milestone 2 progress report. After adjusting our efforts to be focused on the analyzing of Facebook's open source coding libraries, utilizing the Postman API for HTTP method captures, and training the coding algorithms with different test model loads to draw conclusions about potential privacy implications; we have progressed through our milestone 3 objectives, achieving new information and results that align with our project's scope.

Splitting up the work load for this milestone looked differently than earlier on in the semester. Individually, we either researched, tested, documented, and/or produced our findings to compile in this final deliverable. Most efforts were directed towards our environment setup and training the coding algorithms and testing the models. Next, we also conducted more research into terminology, DeepMask and MultiPathNet neural network diagrams, documentation, and a more in-depth search for supplemental literature reviews on the coding algorithms we choose.

Ultimately, from analyzing and training the code algorithms from Facebook's open source libraries, we are able to pull implications regarding facial recognition, bias, and privacy. Listed below are our outcomes.
