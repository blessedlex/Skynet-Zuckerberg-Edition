# Progress Report (10.28.2020)
## Overview
For the duration of this semester, our team has utilized a private Slack channel for communication, the GitHub issue tracker, and Projects section to create a sprint plan. This was our initial effort to organize and plan for our research, testing, and establishing the neccessary work environments. Our efforts have been focused on the analyzing of Facebook's open source coding libraries, observing the behavior of Facebook's facial recognition feature, passive network packet capturing, REST API's for HTTP method captures, and training the coding algorithms with different test model loads to draw conclusions about potential privacy implications. We have spent time taking on tasks in groups of two, to help compare tests and results. Going forward, our efforts will be zoned in on our code algorithms from Facebook's open source library and any implications regarding facial recognition and privacy.

## Outcomes
* <b> Outcome 1</b>: Thus far, we have achieved the outcome of how the auto-tagging feature is being used on the Facebook UI. The feature behaves according to the user's settings and with this result, it behaves as expected. We are seeking to extensive testing on the accuracy of this behavior.

* <b> Outcome 2</b>: We have been able to decrypt the TCP packet information from Wireshark that tells us what is being sent over the network. The information yielded browser information that may need more testing.

## Hinderances
Our challenges included miscommunication in regard to how we wanted to obtain the implications for privacy. We believed our goals would be best tackled by analyzing the code libraries to see what inputs Facebook was taking and testing by observing the UI and packet captures to review the accuracy of the data information.

## Ongoing Risks
|Risk Name  | Impact     | Likelihood | Description | Mitigation | Updates |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
|Team Member Availability (28) | 7 | 4 | Aligning meeting times around academic and work schedules may deem difficult | Plan is to meet each week after weekly check-ins with Dr. Hale until an issue may arise | Members have been available weekly to address project needs |
|Communication/Under communication (24) | 8 | 3 | If any requirements are misinterpreted by the project team a gap develops between expectations, requirements and milestones | May need to communicate the same idea many times in different ways before people remember it | Miscommunication has been the biggest downfall for our team, we have not been able to complete our projects goals to our expectations due to this |
|Software Availability (27) | 9 | 3 | Not all of the necessary software for analysis may be open source | Work around would be to check UNO's available software for students or low cost subscription options| Only one of our group members has the PC capabilities to run tests |
|Analysis Complexity (28) | 7 | 4 | The scope of the analysis may be very large for our time frame | Focus on AI and facial recognition and its handling specifically instead of all the research of Facebook's AI and data usage| Testing the algorithms will provide the implications we are searching for |
| Learning Curves (35) | 7 | 5 | Project team may need to acquire new skills for the project so there's a risk that productivity will be low | Try to keep the best member for a certain task doing what they understand best | No changes |
