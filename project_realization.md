# Progress Report (10.28.2020)
## Overview
For the duration of this semester, our team has utilized a private Slack channel for communication, the GitHub issue tracker, and Projects section to create a sprint plan. This was our initial effort to organize and plan for our research, testing, and establishing the neccessary work environments. Our efforts have been focused on the analyzing of Facebook's open source coding libraries, observing the behavior of Facebook's facial recognition feature, passive network packet capturing, REST API's for HTTP method captures, and training the coding algorithms with different test model loads to draw conclusions about potential privacy implications. We have spent time taking on tasks in groups of two, to help compare tests and results. Going forward, our efforts will be zoned in on our code algorithms from Facebook's open source library and any implications regarding facial recognition and privacy.

## Outcomes
* <b> Outcome 1</b>: Thus far, we have achieved the outcome of how the auto-tagging feature is being used on the Facebook UI. The feature behaves according to the user's settings and with this result, it behaves as expected. We are seeking to extensive testing on the accuracy of this behavior.

* <b. Outcome 2 </b>: We have been able to decrypt the TCP packet information from Wireshark that tells us what is being sent over the network. The information yielded browser information that may need more testing.

## Hinderances
(insert brief discussion of challenges encountered)
Our challenges included miscommunication in regard to how we wanted to obtain the implications for privacy. We believed our goals would be best tackled by analyzing the code libraries to see what inputs Facebook was taking and testing by observing the UI and packet captures to review the accuracy of the data information.

## Ongoing Risks
(address your project risks identified from Milestone 1 and update them based on your current progress, this should be a table)
