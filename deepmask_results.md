Demonstrated results from the training of the coding algorithm DeepMask.


| Batch Size | Mean  | Median | IoU@0.5 | IoU@0.7 |
| ---------: | :---: | :----: | :-----: | :-----: |
|       100% | 66.45 | 74.38  |  78.23  |  57.73  |
|        20% | 57.93 | 65.78  |  67.87  |  43.19  |


Both the 100% and 20% batch size model appeared to struggle for an IoU of 0.7
