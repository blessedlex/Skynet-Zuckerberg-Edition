What have others done to inform our idea? What other ideas can we build upon?

1. Should facial recognition be banned? <br>
The problem the paper conveys to the reader the ethicalness of facial recognition. Is this technology going to put user private information on risk. Technology is expanding rapidly, and due to this, people have to take many cautionary steps to protect themselves and their family. With facial recognition being a new technology, many people will not understand what the information is actually obtaining.
2. Research Questions.<br>
	Is this ethical?<br>
	What are the positives and negatives?<br>
	Do the positives out way the negative?<br>
	There are many research papers on how facial recognition, but many do not talk about the ethical use of the technology. Other papers do not try to tackle both sides of the argument. The author will generally present one side very well, but many do not mention the other side.<br>
3. Contribution<br>
The paper presents many credible people talking about facial recognition in different view from both an application side to a law side. This allows the reader to see the side by side comparison of the positive uses of facial recognition and fears of people trying to use this technology.<br>
This paper never truly left a conclusion. The thing that was surprising about it is how facial recognition is a double edge sword. The potential of the positive side and negative are very high. The positive side will allow protection for border security, but on the opposite spectrum it can lead to people getting misidentified in criminal investigation.
4. Rationale<br>
 An argument for the negative aspect of facial recognition is that people do not give consent for their faces to have facial recognition by law enforcement. For the positive though, facial recognition is being used effectively to help protect people who could do harm to the country.
The paper has many different professionals in their field. For example, there is lawyer talking about how facial recognition by law enforcement can conflict with many different laws for privacy. They also brought different technology people to help give them ways to implement the technology
5. Investigative Approach<br>
The research approached that was used for the source was question and answer. The setting was a congressional testimony, but the all of the information originates from the experience of the professionals that were question that day. The goal of this research was to provide research to the reader to develop opinion based on facts and arguments of confliction sides.
6. Lessons Learned<br>
One of the huge finding is that it can violate people’s right to privacy. The paper talks about how people can have their person biometric data stored without their knowledge. They make an argument about police can do, and how is very similar to that. On the other hand, the paper gave statistics about how it has prevented people from entering the country based on false identity. The paper also gave some implications where facial recognition could be implemented, but regulated how it can be used.
7 Implications of Practice<br>
This article is improving the field from a policy view. This paper is allowing the government to learn more about facial recognition. Through this Congress can decide to whether to regulate the applications of facial recognition or to allow without restriction. If Congress decides to create laws on facial recognition, it would be made with the professional opinion in mind, so there could be a perfect balance.

8. Implication for research<br>
Trough this paper, there will be more investigations in how this information is being use and whether this will be mishandled. Since facial recognition is relatively a new technology, there are still unknown threats to people. There will be investigations how the information being used, and whether it will conflict with current laws. There will be investigations of how this information can threaten the privacy of regular citizens.

1. Problem Statement:<br>
The problem that paper tries to answer how companies and customers communicate when it comes to obtaining personal information. This an urgent problem, there are many times when companies retrieve information, but they never notify the companies at times.
2. Research Questions<br>
What are universal standards when dealing with facial recognition Data?
There is no universal standard for companies when it comes to facial recognition data. Facial recognition is a new technology, and there are still many unknowns. This case study focused on a state law, but not a national law. Without the law, the court case would have never happened.
3. Contribution<br>
A contribution that was made showed that courts could intervene in a dispute between the company and a customer’s data. It shows people that can fight companies to make be held accountable with user information. It was surprising to see the conclusion of the verdict. It was decided that Facebook was guilty of doing harm by not notifying the users that there facial recognition would be saved in their database.
4. Rationale<br>
The court decided that Facebook was in doing harm by not notifying the users that their biometric data their were great harm. It was on the base of them not bases the biometric data is closely related other personal information such as social security data. Therefore if there would be any damage, it would be similar to those.
5. Investigative approach<br>
The approach to the court case was a review of the time and where the data was recorded, and the court review past court decides that deal with similar matters on the subject. With law, the court has to figure what the law means, and how other court decisions can affect decision.
6. Lessoned Learned<br>
The primary findings of the case study that Facebook violated the law by notifying the customer of regarding the recording of their biometric data. Also, they decided that biometric information falls under the same umbrella of personal information. This is a huge impact towards companies and their policies.  It shows that companies are not allowed to take the personal information and use for their own personal game.
7. Implications for practice<br>
This means Facebook is going to have to reexamine the policies with user’s personal information with facial recognition. They are going to back into their and make sure they are more open with their users about which information is being stored.
8. Implications for research<br>
For research, there are going to be more studies of how tech giants handle information, and they are going to be more transparent in their privacy terms of the information will be used, and how it will be used to benefit the user. There will be more studies about the law side. Law makers have to looks at the negatives of this technology and create laws to keep the user’s safe or lessen the impact.

1. Problem Statement<br>
The primary problem of the project was testing to see if facial recognition can be used to identify people by through their passport. National Security is a huge subject in the governing bodies of each country. If a technology, can help check people’s identity
2. Research Questions<br>
Is facial recognition accurate to be used outside or for border security?
The reason there is not much research is due to it still being an emerging technology. Each company with facial recognition are trying to improve the technology. There are many uncertainties with technology and how it can affect the privacy of others.
3. Contribution<br>
One major contribution was deciding the accuracy. This allows the reader to have greater confidence in these technologies. It was  very surprising to see how many false positives there were. This is one of many fears of misidentifying people, but this only on the passports.
4. Investigative Approach<br>
This research was conducted by conduction an experiment. They tested the facial recognition in an outside environment, which resulted in low success rate. By using the facial recognition on pictures, the researchers were able to get a much higher success rate. The claims are strong, since they used more than one facial recognition program.
5. Lessoned Learned<br>
They found out by using the facial recognition on pictures, they were able to get a higher success rate. This could have an impact by having a practical implementation of these facial recognitions for passports. It would lead to more development for the cameras that are used outside.
6. Implications for Practice<br>
For border security, there would be an increase implementation, but there would be a major shift in policies. Since the research ended in a great result, they have data to back up their claims. Another thing that will change is a new security measure to protect these data.
7. Implications for research<br>
The research will advance by doing different test to test different facial recognition systems. Then, the research will continue to test facial recognition in the outside world. Since, there was not much success, this where there will have to advance the technology in.
